Ethereum voting [Smart Contract](Voting.sol) 
deployment interaction with it via [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc).


+ Lists available accounts
+ Compiles a Smart Contract
+ Deploys a Smart Contract
+ Executes Smart Contract's methods
+ Has an UI to interact with the Smart Contract

Voting process:
+ Smart Contract is deployed to Ethereum network with **a list of candidates**.
+ Everyone in the network can vote for these candidates without limitations (except of their balance).
+ Everyone in the network can check how many votes particular candidate has.

How to Launch This Example
--------------------------

1. You will need latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
2. Clone this repository and `cd` to it.
3. Run `npm install`. In case of Windows, before running `npm install` do [this](https://medium.com/@PrateeshNanada/steps-to-install-testrpc-in-windows-10-96989a6cd594). Any errors in console? Google for them.
4. Run TestRPC network emulator: `./node_modules/.bin/testrpc`.
5. Run `node deployContract.js` and see the result.
5. Open [client/index.html](client/index.html) file and play with decentralized application from UI!

[Voting.ABI.json](Voting.ABI.json) is just an [ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI)
of compiled contract. Also, `deployContract.js` script will generate `client/votingContractData.js`
file to access the contract in test network from the client side ([client/index.html](client/index.html)).

Those pull request which **update** dependencies to their newer versions are very welcome. Due to
Ethereum is under active development, its API changes respectively from time to time.
